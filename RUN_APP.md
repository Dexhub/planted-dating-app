## Troubleshooting

### MongoDB Connection Error
If you see MongoDB connection errors:

2. Start MongoDB: `mongod`
3. If permission errors, create data directory: `sudo mkdir -p /data/db && sudo chown -R $(whoami) /data/db`

### Port Already in Use
If port 5001 is in use:
1. Find the process: `lsof -i :5001`
2. Kill it: `kill -9 <PID>`
3. Or change the PORT in backend/.env
