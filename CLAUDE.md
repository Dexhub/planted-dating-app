# Claude Code Configuration - SPARC Development Environment (Batchtools Optimized)

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message:

### ðŸ”´ MANDATORY CONCURRENT PATTERNS:
1. **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
2. **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
3. **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
5. **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### âš¡ GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**Examples of CORRECT concurrent execution:**
```javascript
// âœ… CORRECT: Everything in ONE message
[Single Message]:
  - TodoWrite { todos: [10+ todos with all statuses/priorities] }
  - Task("Agent 1 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 2 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 3 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Read("file1.js")
  - Read("file2.js")
  - Write("output1.js", content)
  - Write("output2.js", content)
  - Bash("npm install")
  - Bash("npm test")
  - Bash("npm run build")
```

**Additional Memories:**
- Deploy architecture hive to design the complete system 
  - Command: `npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn \ "Design complete Planted architecture with microservices: authentication, matching engine, real-time chat, media service. Create architecture diagrams and API specifications" \ --topology hierarchical \ --agents 8 \ --claude`
  - This command uses a hierarchical topology with 8 agents to comprehensively design a complex microservices architecture for the Planted system, focusing on key services like authentication, matching, chat, and media
