# Planted ML Recommendation Engine Architecture

## System Overview

The Planted ML recommendation engine is a sophisticated hybrid system designed specifically for plant-based dating compatibility matching. It combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and deep learning to provide highly accurate and personalized match recommendations.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Hybrid Recommendation Engine

#### Content-Based Filtering

- **Semantic Analysis**: Bio text analysis for personality traits and interests
- **Preference Vectors**: Multi-dimensional compatibility scoring
- **Feature Importance**: Weighted attributes based on user priorities

#### Collaborative Filtering
- **User-Item Matrix**: User interactions with potential matches
- **Matrix Factorization**: SVD/NMF for latent factor discovery
- **Neighborhood Methods**: K-nearest neighbors for similar user patterns
- **Implicit Feedback**: Swipes, views, message exchanges, response rates

#### Deep Learning Component
- **Neural Collaborative Filtering**: Deep neural networks for complex pattern recognition
- **Embedding Layers**: User and item embeddings for representation learning
- **Multi-Layer Perceptrons**: Non-linear interaction modeling
- **Attention Mechanisms**: Focus on important compatibility factors

### 2. Feature Engineering Framework

#### Dietary Journey Vector (4 dimensions)
```python
dietary_journey = [
    motivation_score,      # 0-1: Why they chose plant-based lifestyle
    strictness_level,      # 0-1: How strict they are with their diet
    journey_stage,         # 0-1: How long they've been plant-based
    social_comfort        # 0-1: Comfort level in non-vegan social situations
]
```

#### Values Alignment Vector (5 dimensions)
```python
values_alignment = [
    animal_rights_score,   # 0-1: Importance of animal welfare
    environmental_score,   # 0-1: Environmental consciousness
    health_motivation,     # 0-1: Health-focused motivation

]
```

#### Lifestyle Compatibility Vector (3 dimensions)
```python
lifestyle_compatibility = [
    cooking_skill_level,   # 0-1: Plant-based cooking expertise
    sustainability_practices, # 0-1: Overall sustainable living
    community_involvement  # 0-1: Involvement in plant-based community
]
```

#### Behavioral Features
```python
behavioral_features = [
    swipe_selectivity,     # Ratio of right to left swipes
    message_quality_score, # NLP analysis of message content
    response_time_pattern, # Average response time and consistency
    engagement_depth,      # Conversation length and quality
    profile_completion,    # How complete their profile is
    activity_frequency     # Daily/weekly app usage patterns
]
```
