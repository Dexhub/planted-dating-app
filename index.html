                        <p>Our application process is personal and thorough. You'll answer 10 thoughtful questions about your plant-based journey, values, and what you're looking for. We review each application manually within 24-48 hours, looking for authenticity and genuine commitment to plant-based values.

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We believe in organic connections over algorithms. With only 100 members per city, everyone gets to know each other naturally. We host weekly events like vegan cooking classes, farmers market visits, and plant-based restaurant meetups. You can also browse profiles and send thoughtful messages. Our matching is based on shared values, lifestyle compatibility, and genuine interest - not superficial swipes.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Safety is our priority. After your application is approved, you'll record a simple 10-second video selfie saying your name and the word "Planted." This ensures every member is a real person, not a fake profile or catfish. We also verify profile photos match the video. This extra step creates a safer, more trustworthy community where you can focus on genuine connections.</p>

                        <p>Absolutely not! We welcome vegetarians, vegans, and anyone genuinely committed to reducing animal products in their diet. Whether you're plant-based for health, environmental, or ethical reasons - or still transitioning - you belong here. What matters is that you respect these values and are looking for someone who shares this lifestyle. We believe in supporting each other's journey, not judging where you are on it.</p>

We provide specific feedback on what we'd like to see more of - usually it's about sharing more details about your plant-based journey or being more specific about what you're looking for.

                        <p>Founding members pay just $19/month and lock in this rate for life. When we launch to the public, membership will be $49/month. This investment ensures our community stays high-quality and spam-free. Unlike free apps filled with casual users, our members are serious about finding meaningful connections. The fee also allows us to manually review every profile and host real-world events. You can cancel anytime, but founding members who stay keep their $19 rate forever.</p>
